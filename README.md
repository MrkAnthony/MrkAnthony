# 👋 Hi, I’m @MrkAnthony
  Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little about me:
 
## 👀 I’m interested in
  As a computer science student, I'm deeply fascinated by the endless possibilities that coding and software development present. I have a penchant for exploring different areas within this vast field and enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies and programming languages.
  In my spare time, I love to work on random projects. These projects range from practical applications that solve everyday problems to experimental ventures where I test out new ideas or technologies. This not only helps me in applying what I've learned in my coursework but also pushes me to think creatively and innovatively.
 
## 🌱 I’m currently learning 
   I am currently diving into the world of JavaScript. My goal is to gain proficiency in this versatile language to enhance my web development skills. I'm particularly excited about exploring frameworks like React and Node.js, which will enable me to create more dynamic and interactive web applications.
  Alongside JavaScript, I'm also refining my skills in Java. Java's robustness and portability make it an ideal choice for several of my ongoing projects, especially those related to backend development and Android app development. By deepening my understanding of Java, I aim to build more efficient and scalable applications.
 
## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
   I am always on the lookout for exciting collaborative opportunities that allow me to apply and enhance my skills in JavaScript and Java. Here are a few types of projects I’m particularly interested in:
   
 -  **Web Development Projects**: Partnering on building innovative web applications, especially those that are focused on user experience and utilize modern JavaScript frameworks.
 -  **Game Development**: Working on small to medium-scale game development projects, where I can blend creative storytelling with technical skills.
